        <h2>Wine, gastronomy, culture and fun!</h2>
        <p><p>As we know, in the modern world travel is becoming more and more popular as an amusement for a people. But what we are most offered are tours that are full of information, from which we probably remember only 10% on the next day. Therefore, our approach is different - we provide information very neatly, carefully and dosedly to our guests.</p> <p>Despite the fact that we have a specific program - not one tour is the same because our guests has an opportunity to be more tour participants but not just listeners. In this, we are greatly helped by individual communication with them, the games that we have invented for our project and, of course, the alcohol that we try while we ride around the city. We sell emotions and get them in return. Also, we must not forget that tourism research fully acknowledges the role of food and wine as contemporary cultural resources.</p> For all this, we have created a wine tasting bus, which allows people to explore the city sights while enjoying different drinks right on a special bus, with a feast inside. This is a mobile mini-bar where you can have fun while you move around the city. By this way, we said a new word in the field of tourism.

        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p><div style="text-align: left;">
  <p>
      Project "Wine Bus" is a brainchild of Giorgy Matsaberidze and Sofia Babluani, who was inspired to launch it 
      after many years planning countless trips for customers in Georgia.
  </p>  
  <p>
    We were always seeking a new way of travel and adventure. The main idea was to make a trip joyful, delicious, 
    interesting and curious. The project has existed since 2018 and despite the fact that from the beginning it was an 
    experimental startup - just in a 
    few months the product has became very interesting and attractive. We can confidently say that the experiment was a success.
  <p>
  </p>
    After 4 successful years of the project's existence we decided to implement our project 
    in different cities of Europe with the greatest numbers of visitors. 
    First of all, we focus on countries that have a high culture of drinking wine and other alcoholic beverages.
  </p>
  <p>
    We consider Spain as the first country after Georgia. We intend to move to Spain 
    in order to use our experience for a correct and efficient implementation of our plan, 
    and fully participate in company management there.
