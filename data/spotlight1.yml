  <p>As we know, in the modern world travel is becoming more and more popular as an amusement for a people. But what we are most offered are tours that are full of information, from which we probably remember only 10% on the next day. Therefore, our approach is different - we provide information very neatly, carefully and dosedly to our guests.</p> <p>Despite the fact that we have a specific program - not one tour is the same because our guests has an opportunity to be more tour participants but not just listeners. In this, we are greatly helped by individual communication with them, the games that we have invented for our project and, of course, the alcohol that we try while we ride around the city. We sell emotions and get them in return. Also, we must not forget that tourism research fully acknowledges the role of food and wine as contemporary cultural resources.</p> For all this, we have created a wine tasting bus, which allows people to explore the city sights while enjoying different drinks right on a special bus, with a feast inside. This is a mobile mini-bar where you can have fun while you move around the city. By this way, we said a new word in the field of tourism.
