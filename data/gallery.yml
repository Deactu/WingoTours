      Project Wine Bus is the brainchild of Giorgi Matsaberidze and Sofia Babluani, who was inspired to launch it after many
      years planning countless trips for customers in Georgia.
    </p>  
    <p>
      We were always seeking a new way of travel and adventure. The main idea is to make a trip joyful , delicious, interesting and
      curious. The project has existed since 2018 and despite the fact that from the beginning it was an experimental startup just
      in a few months,the product has become very interesting and attractive. We can safely say that the experiment was a success.
      After 4 successful years of the existence of the project, we decided to implement our project in different cities of Europe with
      the greatest numbers of visitors. First of all, we focus on countries where there is a culture of wine or other alcoholic beverages.
    </p>
    <p>
      We consider Spain as the first country, after Georgia. We intend to move to Spain, in order to use our experience for the
      correct, efficient implementation of the plan and fully participate in the running of the company.
