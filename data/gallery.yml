        Project "Wine Bus" is a brainchild of Giorgy Matsaberidze and Sofia Babluani, who was inspired to launch it 
        after many years planning countless trips for customers in Georgia.
    </p>  
    <p>
      We were always seeking a new way of travel and adventure. The main idea was to make a trip joyful, delicious, 
      interesting and curious. The project has existed since 2018 and despite the fact that from the beginning it was an 
      experimental startup - just in a 
      few months the product has became very interesting and attractive. We can confidently say that the experiment was a success.
    <p>
    </p>
      After 4 successful years of the project's existence we decided to implement our project 
      in different cities of Europe with the greatest numbers of visitors. 
      First of all, we focus on countries that have a high culture of drinking wine and other alcoholic beverages.
    </p>
    <p>
      We consider Spain as the first country after Georgia. We intend to move to Spain 
      in order to use our experience for a correct and efficient implementation of our plan, 
      and fully participate in company management there.
